## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My Key Steps

1. Using "data.js" to store all the data into an global array.
2. Introducing data in index.html ( <script src="data.js"></script>)
3. Using DOM selector and forEach() to dynamic generate all the testimonial cards.
4. Using CSS Grid to arrange the cards. Thanks to Kevin Powell's Responsive Layouts lession. Get much more experience in CSS Grid.If you are interested ,pls follow the link:

5. Started to using {LESS} preprocessor to generate the CSS code.
